# Nashville-Housing-Data-Cleaning

This project involved using MySQL to clean and prepare a Nashville housing dataset with over 56,000 rows for analysis. The primary focus was on resolving various data quality issues to enhance the dataset's usability. 

Key tasks included:

- Standardizing Date Format: Ensured consistency across the dataset.

- Populating Null Property Addresses: Filled missing data in the PropertyAddress column.

- Breaking Down Address Information: Separated City, State, and House Address into individual columns for both Property and Owner addresses.

- Standardizing Categorical Values: Converted 'Y' and 'N' values to 'Yes' and 'No' in the "Sold as Vacant" field.

- Removing Duplicates: Cleared duplicate entries to ensure data accuracy.

- Deleting Unnecessary Columns:  Removed unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset.

The cleaned and well-structured dataset is now better suited for accurate analysis, supporting informed decision-making.
